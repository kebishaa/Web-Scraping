# Web-Scraping
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Python, in combination with libraries like Beautiful Soup, makes web scraping straightforward and efficient. Here’s a guide to getting started with web scraping using Beautiful Soup:

# Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You need the following libraries:

requests: To fetch HTML content from a webpage.
beautifulsoup4: To parse and extract data from HTML.
Install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
# step 2: Parsing HTML
Beautiful Soup supports multiple parsers:

html.parser (Python’s built-in HTML parser)
lxml (faster, requires installation of the lxml library)
html5lib (more lenien

# Navigating the DOM
soup.title: Extracts the <title> tag.
soup.title.text: Extracts text from the <title> tag.
soup.find('tag'): Finds the first occurrence of a tag.
soup.find_all('tag'): Finds all occurrences of a tag.
# Extracting Attributes
